## Project Overview
It said that, when it comes to spoken language, the majority of sentiment can be deduced from visual cues such as body language and facial expression. This means that there is a vast amount of information that can be deduced from images. Many people even invest time into studying body language for a vast majority of reasons from being able to get messages across to people to improving social skills. Regardless of what angle you look at it from many people would agree that at least being able to document a reasonably accurate emotion detection model would be very benefical to many people.
the original dataset used for the emotion detection model can be found on Kaggle at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/deadskull7/fer2013
## Business Case 
Imagine you are pitching a business idea on the very popular show shark tank. Lets say your idea is something in the medical field. Now alot of people that watch shark tank will know that mark cuban tends to be skeptical of pitches in the medical field particularly if the persons ideas cannot be backed by their own research. So if you are doing your medical pitch on shark tank and the model gives you the information that mark has shown disgust anger and sadness while you were speaking you can now readjust who you are pitching too since its clear that you wont be getting an offer from him any more you can cater to the remaining sharks. While this might be a specific example I think this conveys the oppourtunity that a model like this creates for people who have to convey ideas.
